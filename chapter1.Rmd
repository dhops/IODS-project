\textit{The course}
This course is an introduction to using R for basic statistical analysis. It is also a way for people across disciplines and from different universities to connect with a common interest in using data for social science research.

I am excited about the course because it will provide a broader overview than the more specialized courses at Aalto. I stumbled on the course while searching for more socially-oriented data science courses at Aalto.
